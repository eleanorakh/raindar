# Raindar

This gem is a plugin for Lita, a customisable chatbot. To install Lita in your chat room, visit [Lita](https://www.lita.io/).
Raindar is specific to Australia - the chatbot responds to a users request of 'weather LOCATION' with a GIF of the most recent radar from the Bureau of Meteorology. It is responsive to all locations in Australia that have a radar listed on the BOM website.
